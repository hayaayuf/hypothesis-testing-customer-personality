# Hypothesis Testing on Customer Personality

## Objective
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample data to draw conclusions about a population. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha), and then collecting data to assess the evidence.
In this case we want to know, if there's any correlation between customer's education and income.
